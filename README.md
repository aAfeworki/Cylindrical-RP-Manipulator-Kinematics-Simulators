# Cylindrical-RP-Manipulator-Kinematics-Simulators
Interactive Python-based simulators for the Cylindrical RP (Revolute‚ÄìPrismatic) manipulator, including forward kinematics with slider control, forward kinematics driven by inverse kinematics solutions, and an inverse kinematics simulator.



This repository provides interactive simulators for the Cylindrical RP (Revolute‚ÄìPrismatic) Manipulator, implemented in Python using `matplotlib`.  
It demonstrates both forward and inverse kinematics, offering intuitive visualizations to explore the motion of cylindrical manipulators.  



üöÄ Features
- Forward Kinematics (Slider-Controlled)
  Control the manipulator interactively by adjusting the revolute joint angle and prismatic joint displacement with sliders.

- Forward Kinematics (IK-Driven)
  Drive the manipulator using joint variables (angle and displacement) calculated from the inverse kinematics solver.

- Inverse Kinematics Simulator
Enter the equation of a curve on the User Interface to generate joint angles that position the manipulator‚Äôs end-effector.
